===============

Resque Throttle is a plugin for the [Resque][0] queueing system
(http://github.com/defunkt/resque). It adds a ThrottledJob class that will
limit the amount of times it can be enqueued per class. 

To use
------
The job you wish to throttle should inherit from the `Resque::ThrottledJob` class.

In your class, add the `can_run_every` in which the job should be throttled. Example:
```ruby
class MyThrottledJob < Resque::ThrottledJob
  throttle :can_run_every => 24.hours

  #rest of your class here
end
```

By default, the key which identifies the job is simply the class name. This "identifier"
is stored in a redis key with a TTL equal to that of the `can_run_every`. Thus the 
default behavior is a single Job class inheriting from `Resque::ThrottledJob` can only 
run every 30 minutes. 

If you'd like to override that to be more granular, you can do that in the identifier class method
by returning a string. For example, if you want the job to be limited to once a day per
account, do something like the following:

```ruby
class MyThrottledJob < Resque::ThrottledJob
  throttle :can_run_every => 24.hours

  def self.identifier(*args)
    account_id = *args
    "account_id:#{account_id}"
  end

  #rest of your class here
end
```

The *args passed to identifier are the same arguments that are passed to perform.

When a job is throttled, it will raise a `ThrottledError` and the job will not be enqueued.
